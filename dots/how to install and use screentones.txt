   2-a. In the brush setting, pattern section, you will find the screentones


   2-b. Divide your document resolution by 1200. This gives you the number of the scale for the pattern.

    ex. documnet resolution is 300
       
        300 divided by 1200 = .25

         in the brush setting, in the pattern section, change the scale to .25 (don't forget to check
         on pattern)
