IF YOU FOLLOW MY YOU-TUBE VIDEO ON MY SITE:

Do the following: 

Look through each of my videos from how to make an art-brush to bundles. Follow instructions carefully and be mindful of the risks that are related to open-source software and potential corruptions that may occur due to the nature of the product and it's continuous design and re-development. 

If you experience any complications with your Krita Program, please save all your patterns, WorkSapces and Brushes including Brush Predefined Tips.

Go to: C:\Users\('YourNAME'-your computer ID)\AppData\Roaming\krita\share\apps\krita\bundles - delete contents (not the folder) and reset by importing the bundles via the Resource Tool under Settings. Please look through play-lists on my YouTube Account and seek 2 videos that go over how to import and activate your pattern and brush pre-sets using bundles. 


PERSONAL NOTE: 

Krita is an amazing piece of software please ensure to follow the Krita Foundation website and search for following tips and advice on how to use the program. More tutorials will be created with comments and notes below. See more of my art-work by following my Face-book Account... Thank-you :)
